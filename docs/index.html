        <h1>Welcome to the Tab Close Extension</h1>
        <p>This page provides information about the Tab Close Extension's privacy policy.</p>
        <p>Here you can read more about how your data is handled.</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the Tab Close Extension collects, uses, and protects your data. The
            extension aims to provide users with an efficient way to close all open tabs in the browser with a single
            click. We value your privacy and do not collect any personal data. Our primary goal is to offer a simple and
            secure tool for managing your browser tabs.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>The Tab Close Extension does not collect any personal data from users. The only permission requested by the
            extension is the ability to interact with browser tabs, specifically to query and close them as per the
            user’s request. No data is sent to external servers, and no personal identifiable information (PII) is
            gathered.</p>
        <p>The extension operates entirely within the local environment of your browser and interacts only with the open
            tabs in your browser. No browsing history, search queries, or other personal information is collected,
            stored, or transmitted. The extension performs its function by only accessing the tab data that is required
            to fulfill its purpose.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>The Tab Close Extension does not share any user data with third parties. No data is sent or stored outside of
            the user's device. We do not use or share any data with other companies, marketers, or analytics platforms.
            All interactions within the extension are local, meaning any tab management happens directly within your
            browser and is not transmitted to any external systems.</p>

        <h2>4. Security</h2>
        <p>Since the Tab Close Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, there are no specific
            security concerns related to user data. The extension operates with minimal permissions, ensuring that only
            necessary information (open tabs) is accessed temporarily while performing its task. No personal or
            sensitive data is at risk.</p>
        <p>While the extension requests access to browser tabs for its functionality, it does not have access to
            external websites, and no data is stored or processed beyond the user’s browser session.</p>

        <h2>5. User Control</h2>
        <p>As a user, you have full control over the functionality of the Tab Close Extension. You can disable or
            uninstall the extension at any time, which will immediately stop the extension from interacting with your
            browser tabs. Since no personal data is collected or stored, there is no additional user data to delete upon
            uninstallation.</p>

        <h2>6. No Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The Tab Close Extension does not use any third-party services to process or store user data. It operates
            entirely within your browser, ensuring that no personal data is shared or transmitted to external services
            or servers.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy as necessary. Any changes to the policy will be reflected
            on this page, and users will be notified accordingly. Continued use of the extension after changes to this
            Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the extension itself, please feel free to
            contact us at <span class="contact-info">[your-email@example.com]</span>.</p>

        <h2>9. Accessibility</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is accessible via the Tab Close Extension’s Chrome Web Store listing and can be reviewed
            at any time by users who install or interact with the extension.</p>
